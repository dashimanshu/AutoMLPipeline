# AutoML Pipeline Builder

AutoML Pipeline Builder is an open-source Python tool designed to automate the process of building, evaluating, and deploying machine learning pipelines. This tool simplifies the workflow for data scientists and AI practitioners by providing a comprehensive set of features for different stages of the machine learning lifecycle.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Automatic handling of missing values, scaling of numerical features, and encoding of categorical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Automated feature selection and generation.
- **Model Selection**: Automated model selection and hyperparameter tuning using Optuna.
- **Model Evaluation**: Cross-validation and multiple performance metrics.
- **Pipeline Optimization**: End-to-end pipeline optimization for best performance.
- **Deployment**: Easy export of trained models for deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or later). Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Sample Data

Create a `sample_data.csv` file in the `data/` directory. Here is an example dataset:

```csv
age,job,marital,education,default,balance,housing,loan,contact,day,month,duration,campaign,pdays,previous,poutcome,target
30,blue-collar,married,secondary,no,1787,yes,no,cellular,19,oct,79,1,-1,0,unknown,no

```

### Running the Project

To run the AutoML Pipeline Builder, execute the `main.py` script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Code Overview

### `main.py`

- **load_data**: Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
- **preprocess_data**: Sets up preprocessing pipelines for numeric and categorical features.
- **optimize_model**: Uses Optuna to find the best hyperparameters for RandomForest and LogisticRegression models.
- **evaluate_model**: Evaluates the model with the best-found parameters and prints a classification report.

### Example Usage

1. **Load Data**: The script loads the dataset from `data/sample_data.csv`.
2. **Preprocess Data**: Preprocessing pipelines handle missing values, scaling, and encoding.
3. **Optimize Model**: Optuna optimizes model hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluate Model**: The best model is evaluated and a classification report is printed.
